## 1. Importance of Web Accessibility

- Web developers should ensure that everyone can access and enjoy the internet.
- Similar to architects designing buildings with ramps and rails for accessibility.
- Websites need to be built in a certain way to improve accessibility.

## 2. History & Standards

- **1997:** The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) was launched.
- **Sir Tim Berners-Lee:** "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect".
- **W3C's WAI:** Developed specifications and supporting resources for accessibility (considered international standards).
- **2016:** The European Union passed the Web Accessibility Directive, requiring public sector websites and mobile applications to be accessible.

## 3. Disabilities & Web Interaction

- Web accessibility isn't just for visual impairments - it includes:
  - **Visual** (e.g., blindness, low vision)
  - **Audio** (e.g., hearing impairments)
  - **Cognitive & Neurological** (e.g., dyslexia, ADHD)
  - **Physical & Speech** (e.g., limited motor control)

---

## 4. Assistive Technologies

- **Screen Readers:** Read content aloud, used by blind, vision-impaired users, and those with learning difficulties.
- **Speech Recognition Software:** Converts spoken words into commands or text input (useful for those with physical or neurological disabilities).
- **Subtitles & VIdeo Scripts:** Aid users with hearing impairements.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Accessibility

- Think of accessibility from the **start** of the project.
- Retrofitting accessibility is **harder** than building it in from the beginning.
- Use **correct HTML structure:**
  - Proper **paragraph (`<p>`) and heading (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) tags** improve interaction with assistive technologies.
  - Avoid using **multiple line breaks (`<br>`)** for spacing -- use CSS instead.

---

## 6. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- WAI defines **ARIA specification** for improving accessibility in complex web applications.
- ARIA helps in cases where semantic HTML alone is insufficient for accessibility.
