### 1. Understanding Websites

- A website consists of multiple webpages linked together.
- The **anchor(`<a>`) tag** is used to create **hyperlinks** between pages.

### 2. Creating a Second Webpage

- A new webpage for **Little Lemon's Location** is created as `location.html`.
- The same file structure as `index.html` is used.
- Content added to `location.html`:
  - **Heading (`<h1>`):** Our Location
  - **Paragraph (`<p>`):** Address - 123 Rome Road, Main District, Capital City
- **Save the file** using `Ctrl + s`(Windows).

### 3. Linking Pages Using Anchor Tag

- **Navigate** to `index.html` and add a hyperlink
- **Syntax:**
  `<a href="location.html">Our Location</a>`
- **Explanation:**
  - `<a>` tag: Creates a clickable link.
  - `href="location.html"`: Specifies the file to link to.
  - **Displayed text**: Our Location(shown as a clickable blue link).

### 4. Testing the Link

- Save the file and open `index.html` in a web browser:
  - Right-click => Reveal in File Explorer (Windows)/ FInder(Mac).
  - Double-click to open in a browser.
- Clicking on Our Location should open `location.html`.

### 5. Conclusion

- Successfully linked webpages to build a basic website.
- You can now create and connect multiple pages in a website.
