## What is Responsive Design?

- Responsive design ensures a webpage adjusts to different screen sizes (laptop, tablets, mobile phones).
- It allows a website to automatically stretch or shrink depending on the display.
- Essential for providing the best user experience across devices.

## Screen Resolution & Pixels

- Screen resolution = Number of pixels (width x height).
  - Example: 1920 x 1080 pixels (Full HD).
- Modern high-resolution screens use logical pixels for smoother visuals.
- Helps improve text clarity, images, and rounded edges.

## Key Components of Responsive Design

Responsive design is based on three main techniques:

1. Flexible Grids
   - Uses columns, gutters, and margins.
   - Instead of fixed pixel sizes, grids use percentage-based values.
   - Ensures elements adjust dynamically to different screen sizes.
2. Fluid Images
   - Uses `max-width: 100%` in CSS.
   - Images scale down when needed but never exceed their original size.
   - Prevents overflowing content and pixelation on larger screens.
3. Media Queries
   - CSS rules that apply based on screen size, orientation, or aspect ratio.
   - Example: Change the background color when screen width is =< 700px.

```css
@media (max-width: 700px) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```

## Breakpoints

- Breakpoint = The screen width at which content/layout changes to optimize the user experience.
- Different types of grids use breakpoints differently.

## Types of Responsive Grids

1. Fixed Grid
   - Fixed-width columns, flexible margins.
   - Content width does not change within a breakpoint range.
2. Fluid Grid (Full-Width Grid)
   - Flexible columns, fixed gutters & margins.
   - Content expands/shrinks dynamically across screen sizes.
3. Hybrid Grid
   - Combination of fluid-width & fixed-width components.
   - Often used in responsive design frameworks.
