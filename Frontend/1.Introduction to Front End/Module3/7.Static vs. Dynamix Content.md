## Personalized Recommendations in Websites

- Websites provide different recommendations based on user profiles.
- This is achieved through dynamic content adaptation.

---

## Static vs. Dynamic Content

- Static Content:
  - Pre-stored files sent as-is from the web server.
  - Examples: Videos, images, HTML files.
- Dynamic Content:
  - Generated at the time of the HTTP request.
  - Depends on user input or real time data (e.g., news updates).

---

## Role of Web Server vs. Application Server

- Web Server:
  - Sends website content to the browser.
  - Handles static content directly.
  - Acts as a middle layer between the browser and the application server.
- Application Server (Back-End):
  - Generates dynamic content.
  - Handles complex processing: authentication, database queries, and logic execution.
  - Sends processed data back to the web server.

---

## Examples of Static & Dynamic Content

- Static Content Example:
  - Clicking on a video play button -> Web server sends the file.
- Dynamic Content Example:
  - Logging into a course:
    - Web server communicates with the application server.
    - Application server checks enrollment and serves user-specific content.

---

## Application Server Load & Performance Optimization

- Dynamic content generation takes longer due to processing complexity.
- Application servers have limited request-handling capacity.

---

## Caching to Improve Performance

- Caching: Web server stores a copy of dynamic content.
  - First request -> Web server fetches data from the application server and caches it.
  - Subsequent request -> Web server serves caches content instead of reprocessing.
  - Cache updates periodically or with user interaction.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Static content is pre-stored, while dynamic content is generated on request.
- Web servers serve static content and relay requests to application servers.
- Application servers generate dynamic content and handle complex processing.
- Caching reduces the load on application servers, improving response times.
