## Why Use an SPA?

- SPAs provide a fast, mobile-friendly, and engaging experience.
- Examples: Social networks, messaging apps, map applications.
- Traditional websites reload entire pages for every interactions, consuming more bandwidth and server resources.

---

## How Traditional Websites Work

- Every interaction sends a request to the server.
- The server generated and returns a complete HTML page.
- Slow performance, especially for complex sites or poor connections.

---

## How SPAs Work

- Only a single HTML page is loaded initially.
- The page dynamically updates as users interact with it.
- Content is updated via JavaScript without reloading the page.
- Faster, more responsive user experience.

---

## SPA Resource Loading Approaches

1. Bundling:
   - Loads all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at once.
   - Can be slow for large apps.
2. Lazy Loading (Code Splitting):
   - Loads only the necessary resources.
   - Additional resources are fetched as needed.

## Example Scenarios

- Movie Recommendation Feature:
  - Traditional: A new page is loaded with the movie name.
  - SPA: A JSON object with the movie name is returned, and the page updates dynamically.
- News & Profile Pages:
  - Traditional: Full page reload for each section.
  - SPA: Uses templates (views) and updates only the necessary HTML elements with data from JSON responses.

## Choosing Between SPA and Traditional Websites

- SPA Benefits:
  - Faster, smoother interactions
  - Less bandwidth usage.
  - Suitable for apps with dynamic content.
- Potential Downsides of SPAs:
  - Large initial load time (if using bundling).
  - SEO challenges (though modern frameworks address this).

---

## Key Takeaways

- SPAs offer speed and efficiency but may not fit every project.
- Use SPAs for dynamic, interactive apps, and consider traditional approaches for simpler, content-heavy sites.
