## What is React?

- React is a component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces on web and mobile.
- Open-source since 2013, maintained by community contributors and companies.
- Commonly used for single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps (React Native).

---

## Why Use React?

- Reduces code complexity -> Easier to write, test, and maintain.
- Works with other JavaScript libraries for navigation, state management, and API requests.
- Improves performance with optimized updates and rendering.
- Large community -> Many tools and libraries available.

---

## React Components

- Core Concept: React applications are built using reusable components.
- A component is a self-contained UI element (e.g., a music player, photo gallery, or user profile picture).
- Benefits of components:
  - Reusability: Use the same component in different places.
  - Modularity: Develop and test parts of an application in isolation.
  - Efficiency: Avoid rewriting code for repeating UI elements.

## Pre-Built React Components

- Many open-source component libraries for common functionalities:
  - Video players
  - Maps integration
  - UI frameworks (Material-UI, Tailwind, ShadCN)

---

## React Community & Growth

- Annual React conferences introduce new features and encourage community engagement.
- The library is continuously evolving with new improvements.

---

## Conclusion

- React streamlines front-end development by making it modular, efficient, and scalable.
- Instead of building everything from scratch, leverage pre-built components to save time and efforts.
