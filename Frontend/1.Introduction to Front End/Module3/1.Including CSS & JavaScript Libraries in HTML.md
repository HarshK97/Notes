## Introduction

- Developers can build from scratch or use pre-made code (libraries).
- Libraries and frameworks help structure and simplify development.

---

## Dependencies

- Libraries & frameworks = dependencies (needed for the app to function).
- Must be included in the project to call API functions.
- In frontend, dependencies are referenced in the HTML file via `<link>` and `<script>`.

---

## Including CSS Libraries

- Example: **Bootstrap CSS**
  - Add inside `<head>`:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="URL_TO_BOOTSTRAP_CSS" />
  ```

````
	- `href` -> Specifies library URL
	- `rel="stylesheet"` -> Defines it as a stylesheet
---
## Including JavaScript Libraries
- Example **Bootstrap JS**
	- Add inside `<body>`:
	```html
	<script src="URL_TO_BOOTSTRAP_JS"></script>
````

    - `src` -> Specifies library URL

---

## Adding Bootstrap Components

- Example: Adding a button

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Click this button</button>
```

- `btn-primary` -> Adds Bootstrap's a primary color (blue).

---

## Dependency Tree

- Some dependencies rely on other dependencies.
- Can lead to hundreds of dependencies.
- Manually managing them is time-consuming.

---

## Package Managers

- Automates downloading & installing dependencies.
- Most common for frontend: **Node Package Manager (NPM)**.
- Ensures version consistency across teams.
- Handles dependency trees automatically.

---

## Bundling Tools

- Manually adding multiple dependencies -> Inefficient.
- Bundlers: Combine dependencies into fewer or single files.
- Popular bundlers: Webpack, Gulp.
- Large projects use code splitting to optimize loading times.
