## 1. Bootstrap Grid System Overview

- Bootstrap provides a flexible and responsive grid system to create webpage layouts.
- Uses a 12-column grid system, which can be fluid or fixed.
- The grid system consists of three main components:
  - Container: Root element that holds all rows and columns.
  - Rows: Direct children of the container that hold columns.
  - Columns: Define content placement inside rows.

---

## 2. Containers in Bootstrap

- Containers align and pad content based on the screen size.
- There are two types of containers:
  - `.container` -> Fixed width at different breakpoints.
  - `.container-fluid` -> Full width, spanning the entire screen.

---

## 3. Adding Rows and Columns

- Columns must be inside rows for proper alignment.
- By default, if two columns are added in a row, Bootstrap automatically assigns 6 column spaces each (`col-6`).
- You can explicitly define column width using a number suffix:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">Menu</div>
    <div class="col-4">Prices</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- The menu column takes 8 spaces.
- The price column takes 4 spaces.

## 4. Responsive Grid with Breakpoints

- Bootstrap allows different layouts for different screen sizes using breakpoints.
- To stack elements vertically on mobile and side by side on larger screens:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">Menu</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">Prices</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- On mobile (`<992px`): Each column takes 12 spaces (full width) -> stacked.
- On large screen (`>=992px`); Each column takes 6 spaces -> side by side.

---

## 5. Testing Responsive Layouts

- Use Developer Tools (`F12`) to test responsiveness:
  - Click on the mobile/tablet icon to enable device mode.
  - Select different screen sizes to simulate various devices.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways

- Bootstrap's grid system makes layout design easier and faster.
- 12-column structure allows precise content positioning.
- Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.) help create responsive designs.
- No need to design separate layouts for different devices. Bootstrap automatically adjusts content display.
