## Introduction

- Planning an application as a series of components can be challenging at first.
- React allows developers to break down UI into reusable components.
- Every React app has a root component (App component), which contains child components.

## Example: Shopping List Application

### Component Breakdown

1. App Component (Root Component)
   - Contains the NewItemBar and ShoppingList components.
2. NewItemBar Component
   - Allows users to add new items to the shopping list.
3. ShoppingList Component
   - Displays a list of shopping items.
   - Contains multiple ShoppingItem components (one for each item).
4. ShoppingItem Component
   - Represents individual items to the list (e.g., Chicken, Noodles).
   - Items disappear from the list when checked off.

## Example: Blog Website Structure

### Component Breakdown

1. App Component (Root Component)
   - Contains the Navbar and Page components.
2. Navbar Component
   - Displays the blog title, navigation links, and SearchComponent.
3. Page Component
   - Contains:
     - MainFeature Component -> Displays a large featured blog post.
     - SmallFeature Component (used twice) -> Displays two smaller blog summaries.
4. SmallFeature Component
   - Reused twice with different blog post data.
   - Contains a Thumbnail Component to display a blog image.

## Benefits of Component-Based Development

- Reusability -> The same component can be used multiple times with different data.
- Modurarity -> Breaking UI into components makes the application easier to maintain.
- Scalability -> New components can be added or modified independently.

---

## Conclusion

- Breaking down an application into components helps structure the UI efficiently.
- Reusing components saves time and improves maintainability.
- With practice, planning a React component hierarchy becomes second nature.
