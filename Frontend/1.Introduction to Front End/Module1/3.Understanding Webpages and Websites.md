## 1. Webpages vs Websites

- A **webpage** is a document that displays images, text, videos, and other content in a web browser.
- A **website** is a collection of webpages linked together.
- Example:
  - A homepage with links to articles => Clicking a link opens a new webpage.
  - If webpages share a similar address, they belong to the same website.
  - Some links can also lead to other websites (e.g., search results).

## 2. The Growing Internet

- Thousands of websites are launched every day.
- In one week, the number of new webpages equals the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Gia (~2.3 millions).
- Downloading all webpages would take ~3 million years at current speeds.

## 3. The Core Technologies of a Webpage

- A webpage relies on three main technologies:
  - **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**
    - Defines the structure of a webpage.
    - Uses **markup tags** to describe elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and multimedia (audio, video).
  - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
    - Adds visual enhancements (colors, layout, styling).
    - Works by modifying HTML elements to control apperances.
    - Analog: **HTML = Hair, CSS = Hair color and style**.
  - **JavaScript**
    - A programming language built into web browsers.
    - Adds interactivity, data processing, and dynamic content.
    - Example: Form validation, real-time updates on video streaming sites.
    - Analogy: **HTML = Building, CSS = Decoration, JavaScript = Business & Services**.

## 4. How a Webpage is Displayed

- The web server sends a webpage copy to your browser.
- The browser processes each line of code **sequentially**.
- It constructs the **visual representation** of the page.
- This process is called **page rendering**.
