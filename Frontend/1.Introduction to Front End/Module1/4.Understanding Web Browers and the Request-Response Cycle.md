## 1. What is a Web Browser?

- A **web browser** is a software application used to browse the World Wide Web.
- It sends **requests** to a web server and receives **responses** containing content.
- Example: Google Chrome. Firefox, Edge, Safari.

## 2. Components of a URL

- A URL (**Uniform Resource Locator**) consists of:
  - **Protocol** => `http://` or `https://` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
  - **Domain Name** => Name of the website (e.g., `/search`).
  - **File Path** => Path to a specific webpage (e.g., `/search`).

## 3. The Request-Response Cycle

- The browser and the server communicate using **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.
- The process follows these steps:
  1. **User enters a URL** in the address bar.
  2. **Browser sends a request** over the network to a **web server**.
  3. **Web server processes the request** and retrieves data.
  4. **Server sends a response** back to the browser.
  5. **Browser renders** the webpage and displays it to the user.

## 4. Example: Web Search

- You open a web browser and type a search engine's domain name.
- Pressing **Enter** sends a request to the web server.
- The **web server** responds with the search engine's webpage.
- The request is sent to the web server, which processes it using a **database**.
- The request is sent to the web server, which processes it using a **database**.
- The server sends back a **response** with search results, maps, reviews, etc.

## 5. Applications of the Request-Response Cycle

- The request-response cycle is used for many online activities, such as:
  - **Chatting** with friends.
  - **Streaming** movies.
  - **Sharing files** at work.

## 6. Summary

- A **web browser** is an application that requests and displays web content.
- The **request-response cycle** involves sending requests and receiving responses.
- Web servers retrieve and send the required data.
- Every time you browse the web, think about the steps happening behind the scenes!
