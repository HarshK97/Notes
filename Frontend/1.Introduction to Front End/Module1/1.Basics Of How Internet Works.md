## 1. Introduction

- The Internet allows instant access to information
- Users search online and receive responses quickly
- This is possible due to interconnected networks

## 2. How Devices Connect

- Devices connect via **wired or wireless networks**.
- A **network** is formed when two or more devices communicate
- Multiple devices can connect, but direct connections between all devices becomes complex

## 3. Role of Network Switches

- **Network switches** help devices communicate efficiently
- These switches connect multiple devices and other network switches.
- This forms an **interconnected network**, which is essentially the **Internet**

## 4. Client-Server Model

- The Internet is based on the **client-server model**:
  - **Servers**: Provide websites,video streaming, and other online services.
  - **Clients**: Devices that request and use these services

## 5. Global Internet Connectivity

- The Internet connects the entire world.
- Video calls and other data travel through **undersea cables**.
- These cables handle **massive amounts of data per seconds**.

## 6. Conclusion

- The Internet is built on **complex technical systems**.
- Key components: **Devices, Networks, Switches, Servers, Undersea Cables**.
- Understanding these basics gives a clearer picture of how the Internet works.
