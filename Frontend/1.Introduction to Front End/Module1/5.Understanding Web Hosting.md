## 1. What is Web Hosting?

- **Web hosting** is a service that allows you to store your website on a **hosting company's web server** instead of owning a **data center**.
- It provides **stable and secure storage** for individuals and businesses.

## 2. Types of Web Hosting

#### 2.1 Shared Hosting

- **Cheapest** form of web hosting.
- Multiple websites share the **same server resources** (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
- Can **slow down performance** due to shared resources.
- **Best for:** Small websites or personal projects.

#### 2.2 Virtual Private Server (VPS)

- Provides **dedicated resources** (CPU, memory, bandwidth) in a **virtualized environment**.
- Multiple VPS instances run on the same physical server but **don't interfere** with each other.
- **More expensive** than shared hosting but offers **better performance**.
- **Best for:** Medium-sized websites or applications needing **consistent performance**.

#### 2.3 Dedicated Hosting

- A **physical server** dedicated **entirely to you**
- **All resources(CPU, memory, bandwidth) are exclusive** to your website.
- **Most expensive** option but offers **maximum control and performance**.
- **Best for:** Large websites with **high traffic**.

#### 2.4 Cloud

- Uses **multiple physical and virtual servers** to host a website.
- If one server **fails**, another takes over, keeping the site **online**.
- **Scalable** => Pay only for **resources used** (e.g., bandwidth, CPU usage).
- **Best for:** Websites that **need scalability** and **high availability** (e.g., major web applications).

## 3. Key Takeaways

- **Shared Hosting** => Affordable but limited performance.
- **VPS Hosting** => More power and stability at a higher cost.
- **Dedicated Hosting** => Full control but expensive.
- **Cloud Hosting** => Flexible and scalable, but cost depends on usage.
