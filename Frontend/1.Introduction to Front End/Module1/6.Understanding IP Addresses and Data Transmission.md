## 1. Introduction

- **Email** is a common communication method today, but before that, we relied on the **postal system**.
- Surprisingly, there are **parallels** between how postal mail and **computer networks** send and receive data.
- This is made possible through **IP addresses** (Internet Protocol addresses).

## 2. What Are IP Addresses?

- An **IP address** is like a **home address** for devices on the internet.
- It allows **packets of information** to be delivered correctly.

#### 2.1. Types of IP Addresses

- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4):**
  - Contains **four octets** separated by **dots** (.)
  - Example: `192.0.2.235`
- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6):**
  - Contains **eight groups** of **hexadecimal digits** separated by **colons** (:)
  - Example: `4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329`

## 3. How Data is Sent Over the Internet

- Data is sent as **IP packets** (also called **datagrams**).
- Each **IP packet** consists of:
  - **Header** => Contains source & destination IP addresses
  - **Payload** => Contains the actual **data** being transmitted

#### 3.1 Postal System Analogy

- Just like postal mail includes the **sender & recipient address**, IP packets include the **source & destination IP** in the **header**.

## 4. Issues With Data Transmission

- Just like in a **postal system**, network issues can occur:
  - **Packets arriving out of order**
  - **Packets getting lost** in transit
  - **Packets getting corrupted**

## 5. Protocols That Help Data Transmission

- To address these issues, IP packets **carry additional protocols**:

#### 5.1 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- **Solves all issues** (order, corruption, lost packets).
- **Ensures reliable** delivery.
- **Slower** due to **error checking**.
- Used for **files, messages, web pages** (where accuracy matters).

#### 5.2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- **Faster** but can **lose or reorder packets**.
- **Does not guarantee** perfect delivery.
- Used for **voice calls, video streaming, gaming** (where **Speed** is more important than **accuracy**).

## 6. Key Takeaways

- **IP addresses** allow computers to communicate like postal addresses.
- **Packets contain headers and payloads** for delivery.
- **TCP ensures reliability** but is slower.
- **UDP is faster** but may drip or reorder packets.
