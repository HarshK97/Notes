## 1. Introduction

- Have you ever noticed the **lock icon** beside the URL in your browser?
- This means the **HTTPS** (secure HTTP) is being used.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the **core protocol** of the web.
- It allows **browsers** to communicate with **web servers**.

## 2. What is HTTP?

- **HTTP** is a request-response-based protocol.
- It is used to transfer web resources like **HTML, images, and stylesheets**.
- The browser (client) sends an **HTTP request**., and the web server responds with an **HTTP response**.

## 3. Structure of an HTTP Request

- An HTTP request consists of:
  1.  **Method** - Defines the type of action to perform.
  2.  **Path** - Indicates where the resource is stored.
  3.  **Version** - The HTTP protocol version (e.g., 1.1 or 2.0).
  4.  **Headers** - Additional metadata about the request.
  5.  **Body** (optional) - Contains the data being sent (for some methods).

#### 3.1 HTTP Methods

- **GET** => Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST** => Send new data to the server.
- **PUT** => Update existing data on the server.
- **DELETE** => Remove a resource from the server.

#### 3.2. Example Path in a URL

- If requesting an image:
  - URL: `example.com/images/image.jpg`
- The **path** directs the request to the correct location.

## 4. Structure of an HTTP Response

- Similar to an HTTP request, a response includes:
  1.  **Status Code** - Indicates if the request was successful.
  2.  **Headers** - Additional details about the response.
  3.  **Body** - The actual content (e.g., HTML, images).

## 5. HTTP Status Codes

- Status codes are **three-digit numbers** (100-599) grouped by category:

| Category          | Code Range | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Informational** | 100-199    | Interim responses. Example: **100 Continue**.                          |
| **Success**       | 200-299    | Request completed successfully. Example: **200 OK**.                   |
| **Redirection**   | 300-399    | Resource moved. Example: **301 Moved Permanently**.                    |
| **Client Errors** | 400-499    | Issues from the user's side. Example: **404 Not Found**.               |
| **Server Errors** | 500-599    | Issues from the server's side. Example: **500 Internal Server Error**. |

#### 5.1 Common HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK** => Request was successful.
- **301 Moved Permanently** => Resource moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found** => Temporary redirection.
- **400 Bad Request** => Request had invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized** => Authentication required.
- **403 Forbidden** => User does not have permission.
- **404 Not Found** => Resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error** => Generic server failure.

## 6. What is HTTPS?

- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the **secure version** of HTTP.
- It **encrypts** data before sending it.
- Used to protect sensitive data (e.g., login info, credit card details).

#### 6.1. How HTTPS Works

- Encryption turns data into **secret code** before sending it.
- Only the intended recipient can **decrypt** the data.
- This ensures **privacy and security**.
- The **lock icon** in your browser means HTTPS is enabled.

## 7. Key takeaways

- **HTTP is the foundation** of web communication.
- **Requests contain methods, paths, headers, and sometimes body content**.
- **Responses contain status codes, headers, and data**.
- **Status codes indicate success, failure, or redirection**.
- **HTTPS secures data transmission using encryption**.
