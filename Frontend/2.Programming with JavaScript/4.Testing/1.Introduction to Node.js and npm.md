Node.js revolutionized JavaScript by extending its capabilities beyond the browser, allowing developers to build **server-side** applications using JavaScript.

---

## 1. What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on Google's **V8 JavaScript engine**.
- It was created by **Ryna Dahl** in **2009**.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling **backend development**.

### Key Features of Node.js

- [~] **Event-driven and non-blocking I/O** - Ideal for scalable applications.
- [~] **Fast and lightweight** - Thanks to the V8 engine.
- [~] **Cross-platform** - Can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- [~] **Single programming language** - JavaScript can now be used for **both frontend and backend** development.

---

## 2. What is npm (Node Package Manager)?

- **npm** is the **default package manager** for Node.js.
- It allows developers to **install, update, and manage** third-party JavaScript libraries (called **modules** or **packages**).

### Key Features of npm

- [~] Access to **over 11 million packages** from the npm registry.
- [~] Ensures project dependencies are organized in the `package.json` file.
- [~] Supports **version control** and dependency management.

---

## 3. Basic Node.js Commands

| **Command**             | **Description**                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`                  | Opens the Node.js REPL (interactive console).         |
| `node filename.js`      | Runs a specific JavaScript file.                      |
| `npm init`              | Initializes a new project and created `package.json`. |
| `npm install <package>` | Installs a package and adds it to `package.json`.     |
| `npm install`           | Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.   |

---

## 4. Creating a Simple Node.js Project

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
npm init -y
```

- [~] This creates a `package.json` file that manages your project's dependencies.

---

### Step 2: Install a Package

Suppose you want to install the `lodash` library.

```bash
npm install lodash
```

- [~] This command will:
  - Download the package.
  - Add `lodash` to the `dependencies` section in `package.json`
  - Create a `node_modules` folder to store the library.

---

### Step 3: Using the Package in Code

**index.js**

```js
const _ = require("lodash");

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(_.shuffle(numbers)); // Example output: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
```

To run the file:

```bash
node index.js
```

---

### Step 4: Sharing Your Project

If you share your project folder without the `node_modules` folder, others can install the required packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

- [~] This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all listed dependencies.

---

## 5. Key Files in a Node.js Project

| **File/Folder**     | **Description**                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`      | Tracks project information and dependencies. |
| `node_modules`      | Contains installed npm packages.             |
| `package-lock.json` | Locks dependency versions for consistency.   |

---

## 6. Important Tips

- [~] Always run `npm init` before starting a project.
- [~] Use `npm install <package>` with the `--save-dev` flag for **dev dependencies** (e.g., testing tools).
- [~] Keep `node_modules` in `.gitignore` to avoid pushing it to version control.

---

## 7. Practice Challenge

1. Create a Node.js project.

```bash
npm init -y
```

2. Install the `chalk` package (used to style terminal text).

```bash
npm install chalk
```

3. Create a simple script that prints "Hello, Harsh!" in green using `chalk`.

**index.js**

```js
import chalk from "chalk";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello, Harsh!"));
```

4. Run the script using Node.js

```bash
node index.js
```
