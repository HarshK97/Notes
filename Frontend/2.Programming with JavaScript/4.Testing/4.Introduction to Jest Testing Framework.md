# Introduction to Jest Testing Framework

## 1. What is Jest?

**Jest** is a powerful JavaScript testing framework that is widely used for testing JavaScript applications, especially **React, Node.js, and TypeScript** projects.

- [~] Developed and maintained by **Meta**
- [~] Fast, easy-to-use, and beginner-freiendly
- [~] Provides features like **code coverage, mocking, and snapshot testing**

---

## 2. Key Features of Jest

Jest offers several useful features that make testing efficient:

### Code Coverage

- Measures the percentage of code covered by tests.
- Example: **80% code coverage** means 4 out of 5 lines of code are tested.
- Even **100% code coverage** doesn't guarantee every scenario is tested, but it's a useful metric to minimize untested code.

**Command to Generate Code Coverage Report**:

```bash
jest --coverage
```

---

### Mocking

- Mocking simulate functions, dependencies, or API calls in your tests.
- It isolate the unit you're testing from its dependencies.

### Why Mocking is Important?

- [~] Useful when backend services are incomplete.
- [~] Speeds up testing by eliminating dependencies on network requests.
- [~] Helps test code independently of external services.

### Mocking Example in Jest

```js
// Function to fetch user data
const fetchUserData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/user");
  return response.json();
};

// Mocking the fetch function
global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
  Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve({ name: "Harsh Kapse" }),
  }),
);

test("fetches user data correctly", async () => {
  const data = await fetchUserData();
  expect(data.name).toBe("Harsh Kapse");
});
```

---

### Snapshot Testing

- Ensure the **UI** or **DOM** structure hasn't unintentionally changed.
- Jest takes a "snapshot" of the current state and compares future outputs to this reference.

### Snapshot Testing Example

```js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import UserProfile from "./UserProfile";

test("renders the user profile correctly", () => {
  const { container } = render(<UserProfile name="Harsh Kapse" />);
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

## 3. Key Jest Commands

| **Command**             | **Description**                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `jest`                  | Runs all tests                  |
| `jest --watch`          | Re-runs tests when code changes |
| `jest --coverage`       | Generates code coverage report  |
| `jest --updateSnapshot` | Updates snapshot files          |

---

## 4. Why Use Jest?

- [~] Easy setup
- [~] Fast test execution
- [~] Supports **Mocking, Snapshot Testing, and Code Coverage** out of the box
- [~] Great for testing **React, Node.js**, and other JavaScript frameworks.
