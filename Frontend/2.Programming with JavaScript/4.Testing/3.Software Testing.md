## 1. What is Software Testing?

Software testing is the process of verifying that a piece of software:

- [~] **Meets the defined requirements**
- [~] **Works as intended**
- [~] **Does not introduce new bugs**

---

## 2. Three Main Types of Testing

Each type servers a distinct purpose and fits into the **Testing Pyramid**:

```
      ▲
      │ E2E Tests (Slow & Costly)
      │
      │ Integration Tests (Moderate Speed & Cost)
      │
      │ Unit Tests (Fast & Cheap)
      ▼
```

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- [~] **Simulates real-world user interactions**
- [~] Ensures the entire system behaves correctly
- [~] Performed by interacting with the app like a user would

### Example

- Open the website
- Click the **Login** button
- Add an item to the cart
- Proceed to checkout

### Popular E2E Frameworks

- **Cypress**
- **WebDriverJS**
- **Protractor**

> **E2E tests are slow but provide the most comprehensive testing**.

---

## 4. Integration Testing

- [~] Tests how different parts of the system work together.
- [~] Ensures components communicate properly.

### Example

- Testing if a **Login** form sends correct data to the **Auth Service**
- Checking if the **Cart Service** updates after adding an item

### Popular Integration Testing Libraries

- **React Testing Library**
- **Enzyme**

> **Intergration tests are faster than E2E tests but slower than unit tests**.

---

## 5. Unit Testing

- [~] Tests **individual units** (e.g., functions, methods) in **isolation**
- [~] Ensures each function behaves as expected
- [~] Fastest and most cost-effective type of testing

### Example

```js
// Function to test
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Unit Test
test("adds 2 and 3 to return 5", () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

### Popular Unit Testing Frameworks

- **Jest**
- **Mocha**
- **Vitest**

> **Unit tests are fast and should form the bulk of your test suite**.

---

## 6. Testing Pyramid Strategy

The ideal testing struture is:

- [~] **70% Unit Tests**
- [~] **20% Integration Tests**
- [~] **10% E2E Tests**

This balance ensure optimal speed, cost-efficiency, and coverage.

---

## 7. Example Testing Plan

Suppose you're tasked with testing an **e-commerce site**. Here's how you might approach it:

### Step 1: Unit Tests

- Test individual functions like `calculateTotal()` or `formatCurrency()`.

### Step 2: Integration Tests

- Ensure the **Cart Service** correctly updates the total price when adding/removing items.

### Step 3: E2E Tests

- Simulate the full user experience - browsing products, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- [~] **Unit Tests** -> Fast, cheap, and cover core logic
- [~] **Integration Tests** -> Ensure components work together
- [~] **E2E Tests** -> Simulate real user behavior for full-system checks
