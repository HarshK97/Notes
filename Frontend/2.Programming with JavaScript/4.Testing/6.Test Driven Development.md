## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (**TDD**) is a software process where you:

1. **Write a test first** before writing any actual code.
2. **Write the minimal code** required to pass the failing test.
3. **Refactor** the code for clarity, efficiency, or structure without changing functionality.

This process is commonly summarized as:

- [>] **Red -> Green -> Refactor**

---

## TDD Cycle (Red -> Green -> Refactor)

### Step 1: Write a Failing Test (Red)

- Start by writing a **test** that checks the required functionality.
- Since you haven't written the actual code yet, this test will fail.

#### Example: Writing the First Test

Suppose the requirement is:

> "Create a function called `statusOfKeys()` that checks if keys are present."

`statusOfKeys.test.js`:

```javascript
const statusOfKeys = require("./statusOfKeys");

test("checks if statusOfKeys function exists", () => {
  expect(typeof statusOfKeys).toBe("function");
});
```

- [~] The test expects `statusOfKeys` to be a function.
- [!] **Running this test now will fail** because `statusOfKeys` doesn't exist yet.

---

### Step 2: Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test (Green)

- Now write just enough code to make the test pass.

#### Example: Writing the Function

`statusOfKeys.js`:

```javascript
function statusOfKeys() {}
module.exports = statusOfKeys;
```

- [~] Now the test will pass because the function exists (even though it does nothing yet).

---

### Step 3: Write Another Failing Test for New Logic (Red)

- Add more requirement by writing another failing test.

> **Requirement**: "`statusOfKeys()` should accept a `keys` variable and console log its value."

`statusOfKeys.test.js`:

```javascript
test("logs the value of keys variable", () => {
  console.log = jest.fn(); // Mock console.log
  statusOfKeys(true); // Call the function with 'true'
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(true); // Check if console.log received 'true'
});
```

- [!] This test will fail because the function doesn't yet log the `keys` variable.

---

### Step 4: Update Code to Pass the New Test (Green)

- Add just enough logic to make this new test pass.

`statusOfKeys.js`:

```javascript
function statusOfKeys(keys) {
  console.log(keys);
}
module.exports = statusOfKeys;
```

- [~] Now the test passes because the function correctly logs the `keys` variable.

---

### Step 5: Refactor the Code (Refactor)

- Clean up the code without changing functionality.
- Improve readability, structure, or remove redundant code.

#### Example: Refactored Code

`statusOfKeys.js`

```js
function statusOfKeys(keys) {
  console.log(`Keys statusL ${keys ? "Present" : "Absent"}`);
}
module.exports = statusOfKeys;
```

- [~] The code is now cleaner and more informative.

---

### Step 6: Final Test run

- Run all tests again to ensure everything works as expected.

```bash
npm run test
```

- [~] If everything passes, your code is correct and follows TDD principles.

---

## Key Benefits of TDD

- [~] Ensures new code doesn't break existing functionality.
- [~] Acts as documentation for developers joining the project.
- [~] Reduces debugging time by catching issues early.
- [~] Encourages writing only necessary code.
- [~] Enhances confidence in code changes during refactoring.
