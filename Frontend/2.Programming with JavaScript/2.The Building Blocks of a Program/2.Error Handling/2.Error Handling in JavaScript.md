## Introduction

- Errors can stop a program from executing.
- JavaScript provides **try, catch, and throw** statements to handle error and prevent crashes.
- This process is called **error handling**.

## Try, Catch, and Throw Statements

### 1. `try-catch`

- The `try` block contains the code that might cause an error.
- The `catch` block **catches** the error and allows the program to continue.

```js
try {
  console.log(a + b); // a and b are not defined
} catch (err) {
  console.log("There was an error:", err.message);
}
console.log("My program does not stop.");
```

- Output:

```
There was an error: a is not defined
My program does not stop.
```

- **Even though an error occurred, the program continues execution**.

### 2. `throw` Statement

- The `throw` keyword allows you to **manually throw errors**.
- The error must be an instance of `Error` or its subclasses.

```js
try {
  throw new ReferenceError("Custom Reference Error");
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.name + ": " + err.message);
}
console.log("My program does not stop.");
```

- Output:

```
ReferenceError: Custom Reference Error
My Program does not stop.
```

- **You can create and throw custom errors to better control execution**.

## Understanding the `catch` Block

- The `catch` block **receives the error object** and handles it.
- The error object contains:
  - `name`: Type of the error (`ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, etc.).
  - `message`: Description of the error.

```js
try {
  let x = y + 10; // y is not defined
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error Name:", error.name);
  console.log("Error Message:", error.message);
}
```

- Output:

```
Error Name: ReferenceError
Error Message: y is not defined
```

- **This helps in debugging and understanding the type of error**.

## Key Benefits of Using Try-Catch

| **Feature**               | **Description**                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prevents Crashes**      | Ensures that an error does not stop the entire program. |
| **Custom Error Handling** | Allows you to create meaningful error messages.         |
| **Debugging Assistance**  | Helps identify the source and type of an error.         |

## Summary

- **Use** `try-catch` to prevent errors from stopping execution.
- **Use** `throw` to manually create and handle custom errors.
- **Use the error object** (`err`) to get details like error name and message.
- **JavaScript's error handling** helps improve code reliability and debugging.
