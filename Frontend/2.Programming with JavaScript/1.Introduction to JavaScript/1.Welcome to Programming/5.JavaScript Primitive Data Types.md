## Introduction

- Programming can be compared to packing and moving boxes efficiently.
- Choosing the right date types is essential for efficient coding.
- JavaScript has seven primitive data types:
  1. String
  2. Number
  3. Boolean
  4. Null
  5. Undefined
  6. BigInt
  7. Symbol

## Strings and Numbers

- Strings
  - Text values enclosed in single (`''`) or double quotes (`""`).
  - Example: `"Best guitar around"`.
  - Used for titles, descriptions, and text-based information.
- Numbers
  - Direct numerical values (no quotes).
  - Example: `275`.
  - Used for prices, calculations, and numerical data.
- Difference between strings and numbers:
  - Strings allow an almost infinite number of character combinations.
  - Numbers have a wide range but are limited by JavaScript's numerical precisions.

## Other Primitive Data Types

- Boolean
  - Only two values: `true` or `false`.
  - Used for decision-making.
- Null
  - Only one value: `null`.
  - Represents the absence of a value.
- Undefined
  - Only one value: `undefined`.
  - Refers to a variable that had not been assigned a value.
- BigInt
  - Introduced in ES6.
  - Stores very large numbers beyond the Number type limit.
- Symbol
  - Introduced in ES6.
  - Used as unique identifiers, preventing duplicate labels.

## Conclusion

- Each primitive data type serves a specific purpose.
- Choosing the right data type improves efficiency and clarity in programming.
- Understanding and correctly using data types makes you a better JavaScript developer.
