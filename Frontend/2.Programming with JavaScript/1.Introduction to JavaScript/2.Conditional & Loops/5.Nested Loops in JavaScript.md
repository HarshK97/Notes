## Introduction

- Sometimes, you need your code to perform **multiple tasks at the same time**.
- A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop.
- **Nested loops** allow multiple tasks to be executed together.
- However, they can slow down code execution if overused.

## What Are Nested Loops?

- A **loop inside another loop** is called **nested loop**.
- **Multiple levels of nesting** are possible, but too many can reduce performance.
- **Use cases for nested loops**:
  - Processing multiple datasets simultaneously.
  - Iterating through **multi-dimensional data structures**.
  - Automating repetitive tasks in an organized manner.

## Example 1: Two-Week Plan (Days & Weeks)

- Suppose we need to **display days for two weeks (Monday-Friday)**.
- **Outer loop**: Iterates over **weeks**.
- **Inner loop**: Iterates over days.

### Code Example:

```js
for (var week = 1; week <= 2; week++) {
  console.log("Week " + week);
  for (var day = 1; day <= 5; day++) {
    console.log(" Day " + day);
  }
}
```

### Output:

```js
Week 1
	Day 1
	Day 2
	Day 3
	Day 4
	Day 5
Week 2
	Day 1
	Day 2
	Day 3
	Day 4
	Day 5
```

- **Outer loop** runs **twice** (for two weeks).
- **Inner loop** runs **five times per week** (for five days).

## Example 2: Displaying Summer Months Over Two Years

- Suppose we need to **display summer months (June, July, August) for two years**.
- **Outer loop**: Iterates through \*\*years (2023 & 2024).
- **Inner loop**: Iterates through \*\*summer months (June-August , i.e., months 6-8).

### Code Example:

```js
for (var year = 2023; year < 2025; year++) {
  console.log(year);
  for (var month = 6; month < 9; month++) {
    console.log(" --- " + month);
  }
}
```

### Output:

```lua
2023
 --- 6
 --- 7
 --- 8
2024
 --- 6
 --- 7
 --- 8
```

- **Outer loop** iterates **twice** (for two years).
- **Inner loop** iterates **three times per year** (for June, July & August).

## Understanding the Execution Flow

1. **Outer loop starts**, set `year = 2023`.
2. Logs `2023` to the console.
3. **Inner loop starts**, iterates through months `6, 7, 8`:
   - Logs `--- 6`, `--- 7`, `--- 8`.
4. **Inner loop exits**, and control returns to **outer loop**.
5. **Outer loop increments** `year = 2024`, repeats steps 2-4.
6. Once `year` reaches `2025`, **outer loop exits**.

## Best Practices for Nested Loops

- **Use descriptive variable names** (`year`, `month`) or standard practice (`i`, `j`).
- **Avoid unnecessary nesting** as it **reduces performance**.
- **Optimize nested loops** by:
  - Breaking large loops into smaller functions.
  - Using **efficient data structures** like arrays and objects.
  - Exploring **alternative algorithms**.

## Key Takeaways

- **Nested loops** help automate repetitive tasks.
- They are useful for **working with structured data**.
- Too many nested loops **slow down performance**.
- A **good developer writes efficient, optimized code**.
