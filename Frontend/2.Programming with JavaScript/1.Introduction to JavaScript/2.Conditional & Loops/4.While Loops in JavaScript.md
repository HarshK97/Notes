## Introduction

- The **while loop** is similar to the **for loop**, but with key differences.
- We will use a **while loop** to code a countdown to the **Happy New Year**.

## Key Differences Between For and While Loops

1. **Counter Variable:**
   - In a **while loop**, the counter value is set **before** the loop begins and must be explicitly defined.
2. **Condition Declaration:**
   - The **while loop** only requires an **exit condition** inside the parentheses.
   - If the condition evaluates to **true**, JavaScript will execute the loop body.

## Constructing a While Loop

1. **Define a Counter Variable:**

```js
let counter = 3;
```

2. **Declare the While Loop with an Exit Condition:**

```
while (counter > 0) {
 console.log(counter);
 counter--;
}
```

- The condition (**counter > 0**) is checked before each iteration.
- If the condition is **true**, the loop executes.
- The **console.log(counter)** prints the current value.
- The **counter is decremented** after each iteration.

3. **Exiting the Loop:**
   - When `counter` reaches `0`, the condition **counter > 0** evaluates to **false**.
   - The loop terminates, and execution moves to the next statement after the loop.
4. **Adding a Final Message**:

```js
console.log("Happy New Year");
```

## Step-by-Step Execution of the While Loop

- **Initial counter value** = `3`
- **Loop Iterations**:
  1. `counter = 3` -> condition (`3 > 0`) **true** -> print `3` -> update `counter = 2`
  2. `counter = 2` -> condition (`2 > 0`) **true** -> print `2` -> update `counter = 1`
  3. `counter = 1` -> condition (`1 > 0`) **true** -> print `1` -> update `counter = 0`
  4. `counter = 0` -> condition (`0 > 0`) **false** -> loop **terminates**
- **Final output**: `"Happy New Year!"` is printed.

## Summary

- The **while loop** runs **as long as** the exit condition is **true**.
- **Key parts of a while loop**:
  1. **Initialize a counter variable**
  2. **Specify an exit condition**
  3. **Execute loop body**
  4. **Update the counter**
- The **while loop** is useful when the number of iterations is **not predetermined**.
