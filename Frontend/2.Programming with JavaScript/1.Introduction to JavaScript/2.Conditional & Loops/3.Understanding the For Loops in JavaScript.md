## Introduction

Imagine needing to **count from 1 to 3** and then display "Go" in the console. You could manually log each step:

```js
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log("Go");
```

While this method works, it becomes **impractical** for counting **1-10**, **1-100**, or **more**. Instead, we use a **for-loop** for efficiency.

## For-Loop Basics

A **for-loop** automates repetition and consists of:

1. **Counter** - A variable (commonly i) that tracks iterations.
2. **Start value** - The initial value of the counter.
3. **End Condition** - The condition determining how many times the loop runs.
4. **Incrementor** - Defines how the counter changes per iteration.

## Example: Counting from 1 to 3

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log("Go");
```

## Breaking Down the For-Loop

### 1. Counter Initialization

- Declared using let `i = 1;` (i.e., the loop start at 1).

### 2. Condition to Continue

- `i <= 3;` ensures the loop runs while i is **less than or equal to 3**.

### 3. Incrementor

- `i++` increase `i` by **1** after each iteration.
- Alternative syntax: `i = i + 1`.

### 4. Exit Condtion

- When `i` reaches `4`, `i <= 3` returns **false**, and the loop **terminates**.

## Loop Body

- The code inside **curly braces {}** executes each iteration.
- In this case, `console.log(i);` prints the counter value.

## Reverse Counting Example (10 to 1)

You can also **decrement** `i` to count **backwards**:

```js
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log("Happy New Year!");
```

## Explanation

- The loop starts at 10.
- Runs while `i

## Explanation

- The loop starts at 10..
- Runs while `i > 0`.
- `i--` decrease `i` by **1** per iteration.
- Stops when `i` reaches `0`.

## Conclusion

- A **for-loop** automates repetition efficiently.
- It consists of a **counter, condition, incrementor, and loop body**.
- You can **increment** or **decrement** based on your needs.
