## The Benefits of OOP

There are many benefits to using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm:

- OOP helps developers mimic the relationship between objects in the real world, making it easier to reason about software relationship.
- OOP allows you to write modular, flexible, and reusable code.

## The Principles of OOP

The four fundamental OOP principles are inheritance, encapsulations, abstraction, and polymorphism. Objects exist in a hierarchical structure, where the base or super class is the Object class, from which all objects derive.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the foundations of OOP. It works as follows:

- A base class (super-class) exists.
- Sub-classes inherit properties from the base class.
- Sub-sub-classes inherit from sub-classes.
  **Example:**
- Base class: `Animal`
- Sub-class: `Bird` (inherits from `Animal`)
- Sub-sub-class: `Eagle` (inherits from `Bird`)

To set up inheritance in JavaScript, use the `extends` keyword:

```js
class Animal {
  // Base class properties and methods
}

class Bird extends Animal {
  // Bird class properites and methods
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
  // Eagle class properties and methods
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves making the code implementation hidden from other users. Users don't need to know how the code works to use it.

**Example:**

```js
let text = "hello world";
console.log(text.toUpperCase()); // Outputs: HELLO WORLD
```

Users can use the `toUpperCase()` method without knowing its internal implementation.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is about writing code in a generalized way, extracting the concept of what you're trying to do rather than dealing with specific manifestations.

- **Encapsulation**: Hides the internal implementation.
- **Abstraction**: Deals with the concept rather than specific instances.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "multiple forms" and allows objects to take on many shapes.

**Example:**

- A door has a bell that can be rung to get someone to show up.
- A bicycle has a bell that can be rung with a different intention.

In JavaScript, polymorphism allows the same method name to be used with different objects.

**Example:**

```js
class Door {
	bell(){
		console.log("Doorbell rings!")
	}
}

class Bicycle {
	bell(){
		console.log("Bicycle bell rings!)
	}
}

function ringTheBell(thing) {
	thing.bell();
}

const door = new Door();
const bicycle = new Bicycle();

ringTheBell(door); // Outputs: Doorbell rings!
ringTheBell(bicycle); // Outputs: Bicycle bell rings!
```

The `concat()` method in JavaScript is also polymorphic:

- Concatenates strings:

```js
console.log("Hello, ".concat("world!")); // Outputs: Hello, World
```

- Concatenates arrays:

```js
console.log([1].concat([2])); // Outputs: [1,2]
```

### Example of Polymorphism using Classes

```js
class Bird {
  useWings() {
    console.log("Flap flap");
  }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
  useWings() {
    super.useWings();
    console.log("Fly high");
  }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  useWings() {
    console.log("Swim");
  }
}

const eagle = new Eagle();
const penguin = new Penguin();

eagle.useWings(); // Outputs: Flap flap Fly high
penguin.useWings(); // Outputs: Swim
```
