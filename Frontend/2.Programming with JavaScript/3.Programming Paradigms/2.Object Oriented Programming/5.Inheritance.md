## Introduction to Inheritance

- Inheritance in JavaScript revolves around the concept of the prototype.
- A prototype is an object that can hold properties to be shared by multiple other objects.
- JavaScript implements a prototype-based inheritance model.

## Creating Objects with Prototype

- Example object `bird` with propeties:

```JavaScript
var bird = {
  hasWings: true,
  canFly: true,
  hasFeatures: true,
};
```

- Creating a new object using `Object-create()`:

```JavaScript
var eagle1 = Object.create(bird);
console.log(eagle1); // Outputs: {}
console.log(eagle1.hasWings); // Outputs: true
console.log(eagle1.canFly); // Outputs: true
console.log(eagle1.hasFeatures); // Outputs: true
```

## Prototype Chain

- Objects created with `Object.create()` have access to the properties of their prototype.
- Example with another object `eagle2`:

```JavaScript
var eagle2 = Object.create(bird);
console.log(eagle2.hasWings); // Output: true
```

## Overriding Properties

- Properties can be overridden in the new object:

```JavaScript
var penguin1 = Object.create(bird);
penguin1.canFly = false;
console.log(penguin1.canFly); // Output: false
console.log(penguin1.hasWings); // Output: true
```

## Key Points

- JavaScript looks for properties on the object itself first, then up the prototype chain.
- Overriding a property on an object does not affect the prototype or other objects.
- For complex objects and inheritance, using class syntax is recommended for better developer experience, although it still works with prototypes under the hood.
