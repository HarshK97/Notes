JavaScript provides built-in data structure to store and manage data efficiently. The most common ones include **Objects, Arrays, Maps, and Sets**. Additionally, JavaScript offers methods to manipulate these structures, making data processing easier.

---

## 1. Working with Arrays in JavaScript

Arrays store **ordered** collections of values. JavaScript provides built-in methods to operate on arrays efficiently.

### 1.1 The `forEach()` Method

- Iterates over each item in an array.
- Takes a function as an argument, which runs on every element.

**Example**:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num * 2));
// Output: 2, 4, 6, 8
```

---

### 1.2 The `filter()` Method

- Returns a **new array** containing elements that satisfy a condition.

**Example**:

```js
const ages = [15, 22, 18, 30];

const adults = ages.filter((age) => age >= 18);
console.log(adults); // Output: [22, 18, 30]
```

---

### 1.3 The `map()` Method

- Transforms each element in an array and returns a **new array**.

**Example**:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const squared = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

---

## 2. Working with Objects in JavaScript

Objects store **key-value** pairs and are used when data needs to be accessed using **keys**.

### Example: Converting an Object to an Array

```js
const student = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 20,
  grade: "A",
};

const studentArray = Object.entries(student);
console.log(studentArray);
// Output: [['name', 'Alice'], ['age', 20], ['grade', 'A']]
```

> _Note:_ Sometimes, converting an object to an array is necessary when working with certain APIs or libraries.

---

## 3. Working with Maps in JavaScript

Maps store key-value pairs like objects, but **keys can be any type (numbers, objects, functions, etc).**

### Creating a Map

```JavaScript
const studentScores = new Map();
studentScores.set("Alice", 90);
studentScores.set("Bob", 85);

console.log(studentScores.get("Alice")); // Output: 90
console.log(studentScores.size); // Output: 2
console.log(studentScores.has("Bob")); // Output: true
```

_Difference from Objects:_ Maps do not inherit from `Object.prototype`, so they lack built-in methods like `hasOwnPropery`.

---

## 4. Working with Sets in JavaScript

Sets store **unique values**, automatically removing duplicates.

### Creating a Set from an Array

```JavaScript
const numbers = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5];

const uniqueNumbers = new Set(numbers);
console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
```

_Use case:_ Removing duplicates from an array quickly.

## 5. Other Data Structures in JavaScript

JavaScript does not have built-in support for some complex data structures like **Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, or Graphs**. However, they can be implemented manually if needed.

### Examples of Advanced Data Structures

1. **Queue (FIFO - First In First Out):** Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
2. **Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out):** Can be implemented using arrays.
3. **Linked List (Singly and Doubly Linked):** Can be implemented using objects or classes.
4. **Binary Tree:** Can be implemented using objects or classes.
5. **Graph:** Can be implemented using objects or classes.

These structures are useful in **computer science, algorithm optimization, and data handling**.

---

## Conclusion

- **Arrays** are best for ordered lists and looping.
- **Objects** store key-value pairs where keys are strings.
- **Maps** are similar to objects but allow **any** data type as a key.
- **Sets** ensure uniqueness by **removing duplicates**.
- Chossing the right **data structures** improve code efficiency and readability.
