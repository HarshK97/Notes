## Example Code Breakdown

### Initial Setup

Let's begin by breaking down the initial setup:

- **Object Definition**: An object `car` is defined with properties `engine`, `steering`, and `speed` set to `true`, `true`, and `slow` respectively.
- **Object Creation**: Another object `sportsCar` is created using `Object.create()`, inheriting properties from the `car` object. The `speed` property of `sportsCar` is set to `fast`.

```js
const car = {
  engine: true,
  steering: true,
  speed: "slow",
};

const sportsCar = Object.create(car);
sportsCar.speed = "fast";

console.log("The sportsCar object:", sportsCar);
```

### `for-in` Loop

The `for-in` loop is used to log the properties of the `sportsCar` object. This loop iterates over all enumerable properties of the object, including those in its prototype chain.

```js
for (const prop in sportsCar) {
  console.log("for-in loop prop:", prop);
}
```

**Output:**

```
engine
steering
speed
```

### `for-of` Loop

The `for-of` loop is used with `Object.keys()` to iterate over the object's own properties. This loop only consider the properties directly on the object.

```js
for (const prop of Object.keys(sportsCar)) {
  console.log("for-of loop prop:", prop);
}
```

**Output:**

```
speed
```

## Results and Analysis

### `for-in` Loop Output

- The `for-in` loop includes properties from both the `sportsCar` object and its prototype (`car`).
- Output includes: `engine`, `steering`, `speed`.

### `for-of` Loop Output

- The `for-of` loop only includes the `sportsCar` object's own properties.
- Output includes: `speed`.

## Simplified Example

```js
const car = {
  engine: true,
};

const sportsCar = Object.create(car);
sportsCar.speed = "fast";

console.log("The sportsCar object:", sportsCar);

for (const prop in sportsCar) {
  console.log(prop);
}

for (const prop of Object.keys(sportsCar)) {
  console.log(prop);
}
```

**Output:**

```
The sportsCar object: { speed: 'fast' }
speed
engine
speed
```

## Summary

- **`for-in` Loops**: Iterate over the properties of the object and its prototype.
- **`for-of` Loops**: Only iterate over the object's own properties.
