## 1. What is the Spread Operator?

The **spread operator** (`...`) is a **powerful feature introduced in ES6** that helps:

- **Expand** elements of an array or object
- **Copy** properties from one object to another
- **Pass multiple values into a function easily**

Think of it as **"spreading out"** elements from an array or object!

---

## 2. Using Spread Operator with Arrays

### Example: Expanding an Array into a Function

Before ES6, calling a function with array elements required **manual indexing**:

```js
let top3 = ["Colombia", "Argentina", "Brazil"];

function showItinerary(country1, country2, country3) {
  console.log(`1. ${country1}`);
  console.log(`2. ${country2}`);
  console.log(`3. ${country3}`);
}

// Old method (manual indexing)
showItinerary(top3[0], top3[1], top3[2]);
```

- [x] **With the Spread Operator (`...`)**

```js
showItinerary(...top3);
```

**Output**:

```
Colombia
Argentina
Brazil
```

#### Why is `...top3` Better?

- [x] **Less typing**
- [x] **Automatically expands the array**
- [x] **More readable & scalable**

---

## 3. Using Spread Operator with Larger Arrays

What if we have **more places** to visit? Instead of manually indexing, we can use the **spread operator**.

```js
let top7 = [
  "Colombia",
  "Argentina",
  "Brazil",
  "Peru",
  "Chile",
  "Mexico",
  "Ecuador",
];

showItinerary(...top7); // Still works, as long as functions accepts enough arguments!
```

- [x] **More flexible** - No need to manually extract elements!

---

## 4. Combining Arrays with the Spread Operator

We can use `...` to **merge arrays** instead of `concat()`.

```js
let europe = ["London", "Paris"];
let italy = ["Rome", "Venice"];

// Merge using spread
let travelList = [...europe, ...italy];

console.log(travelList); // Output: ["London", "Paris", "Rome", "Venice"]
```

- [x] **Clear syntax**
- [x] **Flexible merging**

---

## 5. Using Spread Operator with Objects

We can also use `...` to **copy or merge objects**.

```js
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
let job = { role: "Developer", company: "Google" };

// Merge objects
let fullProfile = { ...person, ...job };

console.log(fullProfile);
```

**Output:**

```js
{ name: "Alice", age: 25, role: "Developer", company: "Google" }
```

- **Creates a new object wihout modifying originals**.
- **Easier than `Object.assign()`**.

---

## 6. Final Takeaways

- **The Spread Operator (`...`) makes JavaScript more concise & readable**.
- **It simplifies function calls, array operations, and object handling.**
- **Use it for copying, merging, and passing multiple values efficiently**.
