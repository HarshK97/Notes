Merge conflicts happen when two developers modify the same part of a file in different branches. Git can't automatically decide which changes to keep, so **manual intervention is required**.

## Understanding Merge Conflicts with an Example

Imagine **Developer 1** and **Developer 2** both modify a file called `Feature.js` in separate branches:

- **Developer 1** -> Works on `feature1` branch, modifies `Feature.js`, and **pushes changes**.
- **Developer 2** -> Works on `feature2` branch, modifies `Feature.js`, and **pushes changes**.

When **Developer 2** tries to **merge** their branch with `feature1`, Git detects a **conflict**.

## Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution

### 1. Check for Conflicts

When Developer 2 tries to pull or merge, Git shows a conflict message. To confirm, run:

```bash
git status
```

If there's a conflict, it will display **unmerged paths** and ask for manual resolution.

### 2. Identify the Conflicting Changes

Run:

```bash
git diff
```

This shows the exact lines causing the conflict. You'll see markers like:

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
return "too much";
=======
return "way too much";
>>>>>>> feature2
```

- **HEAD** -> Your current branch's version.
- **======** -> Divider between conflicting changes.
- **feature2** -> Incoming changes from the other branch.

### 3. Manually Resolve the Conflict

Open `Feature.js` in an editor and **decide which version to keep** or combine both:

```js
return "way too much"; // Final resolved version
```

Then, **remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `========`, `>>>>>>>>`)**.

### 4. Stage & Commit the Resolved File

After resolving, add the file and commit the changes:

```bash
git add Feature.js
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in Feature.js"
```

### 5. Push the Changes to Remote

Now that the conflict is resolved, push your changes:

```bash
git push origin feature2
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request (PR) to Merge

Finally, Developer 2 submits a **Pull Request** to merge their branch into `main`.

## Best Practices to Avoid Conflicts

- [~] **Pull latest changes before working** (`git pull origin main`)
- [~] **Communicate with team members about changes**
- [~] **Keep changes small and frequent**
- [~] **Use feature branches for different tasks**
