# Introduction to Git and Github

Version control is **essential** in software development for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and maintaining a history of modifications. Two key tools in this domain are **Git** and **Github**.

---

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** that helps developers:

- [~] **Track changes** in files.
- [~] **Collaborate** with multiple developers
- [~] **Revert** to previous versions if needed

### History of Git

Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux) to efficiently manage contributions to the Linux kernel.

### Why Git? (Advantages)

- **Speed & Performance** - Faster than other version control systems.
- **Reliability** - Works offline and keeps a complete history.
- **Free & Open Source** - No licensing fees.
- **Branching & Merging** - Work on multiple features independently.

### Git Basics (Common Commands)

| **Command**               | **Description**                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                | Initialize a new Git repository       |
| `git clone <repo>`        | Clone a repository from a URL         |
| `git add <file>`          | Add changes to the staging area       |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commit changes to the repository      |
| `git status`              | Check the status of the repository    |
| `git log`                 | View commit history                   |
| `git push`                | Push changes to a remote repository   |
| `git puil`                | Pull changes from a remote repository |

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories. It extends Git's capabilities with:

- [~] **Remote storage** for Git repositories
- [~] **Collaboration tools** like pull request
- [~] **Issue tracking** for managing bugs and tasks
- [~] **Access control** for teams and organizations

### Key Features of GitHub

- **Public & Private Repositories** - Share code publicly or privately.
- **Forking & Pull Requests** - Contribute to open-source projects.
- **GitHub Actions** - Automate workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Social Networking** - Follow developers and projects.

| **Feature**    | **Git**                       | **GitHub**                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Type           | Version Control System        | Hosting Platform                    |
| Works Offline? | Yes                           | No                                  |
| Usage          | Track changes locally         | Collaborate and share code          |
| Key Benefits   | Speed, reliability, branching | Remote storage, collaboration tools |
