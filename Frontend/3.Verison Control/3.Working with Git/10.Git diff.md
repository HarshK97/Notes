In programming, just like in writing novels, you often revisit previous versions of your work. Git provides `git diff`, a powerful command to compare changes in files, commits, and branches.

## What is `git diff`?

- `git diff` helps compare different versions of files.
- It shows what has been **added (`+`)** and what has been **removed (`-`)**.
- It can compare **unstaged changes, staged changes, commits, and branches**.

---

## Using `git diff` in Different Scenarios

### 1. Comparing Unstaged Changes

Before staging your changes, you can see what modifications have been made:

```bash
git diff
```

- [~] This will compare the working directory with the **last committed version** (HEAD).

If you only want to check a specific file (e.g., `index.html`):

```bash
git diff index.html
```

---

### 2. Comparing Staged Changes (Before Commit)

Once you've staged a file using `git add`, `git diff` no longer shows the changes.

To check **staged** changes before committing:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

- [~] This will compare the **staged version** with the last commit.

---

### 3. Comparing Changes Between Commits

To compare two commits, you need their **commit hashes**. You can get them using `git log`.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then, use:

```bash
git diff <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>
```

- [~] This will show all the differences between the two commits.

Example:

```bash
git diff a1b2c3d 4e5f6g7
```

- This compares commit `a1b2c3d` with commit `4e5f6g7`.

---

### 4. Comparing Changes Between Branches

If you have multiple branches and want to see the differences between them, use:

```bash
git diff main feature-branch
```

- [~] This will show what's different in `feature-branch` compared to `main`.

---

## Understanding `git diff` Output

When you run `git diff`, you'll see io the following format:

```bash
- This line was removed
+ This line was added
```

- **`-` (minus)** -> Removed line from the old version.
- **`+` (plus)** -> Added line in the new version.

---

## Summary

- [~] `git diff` helps you **track changes** before committing.
- [~] Use `git diff` for unstaged changes, `git diff --staged` for staged changes.
- [~] Compare commits: `git diff <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>`.
- [~] Compare branches: `git diff main feature-branch`.

This command is essential for **debugging and reviewing** changes before committing them to the repository.
