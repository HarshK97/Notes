# Understanding Git Workflows: Feature Branching

A **workflow** is a structured process that developers follow when working on a project. Just like applying for a job involves **steps** (resume, application, interview), a software development workflow includes **pulling, modifying, and pushing code**.

---

## Why Workflows Matter in Git

When working in a **team**, having a workflow ensures that:

- [~] Everyone follows a structured process.
- [~] Code stays **organized and manageable**.
- [~] Developers can work independently **without disrupting the main branch**.

---

## Feature Branching Workflow

A **feature branch** is a separate branch created from the **main branch** to developer a new feature.

- **Main branch (`main`)** -> The stable version of the project (source of truth).
- **Feature branch (`feature-branch`)** -> Branch created to develop a new feature.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide to Feature Branching in Git

### 1. Pull the Latest Code from Remote

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Create a New Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

- `-b` flag creates and switches to the new branch.

### 3. Make Changes & Add files

Modify code or create new files, then stage them:

```bash
git add .
# Or add a specific file: git add filename
git add README.md
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes with a Message

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

- A **clear commit message** helps teammates understand what was changed.

### 5. Push the Branch to Remote

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Now, the feature branch is available on the remote repository.

### 6. Create a Pull Request(PR)

On GitHub:

1. Navigate to your repository.
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"**.
3. Add a description and **request a review**.
4. Once approved, **merge the branch into `main`**.

---

## Why Use Feature Branching?

- [~] **Keeps the `main` branch clean**.
- [~] **Allows multiple developers to work on different features**.
- [~] **Code changes are reviewed before merging**.
