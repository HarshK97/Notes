## What is Local vs. Remote in Git?

- **Local Repository**:

  - Exists **only on your machine** (laptop, desktop).
  - You can work offline, commit changes locally, and push later.
  - Example: `my-second-repo` on your system.

- **Remote Repository**:
  - Hosted on a **server** (GitHub, GitLab).
  - Allows **collaboration** with others.
  - Example: `my-second-repo` on GitHub.

### Syncing Local & Remote

- **Clone** -> Copy a remote repo to your local machine.
- **Pull** -> Get the latest changes from remote to local.
- **Push** -> Send your local changes to the remote.

---

## Creating a Local Git Repository

To start a new project, create a **local** Git repository:

```bash
mkdir my-second-repo # Create a new directory
cd my-second-repo # Move into the directory
git init # Initialize a new Git repository
```

- [~] This creates an **empty local repository**.

Check if it's linked to a remote:

```bash
git remote -v
```

- [!] **No output** means no remote connection yet.

---

## Connecting a Local Repo to a Remote Repository

Now, let's link your local repo to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-second-repo.git
```

- [~] Now `origin` is set as the remote repo.

Verify the connection:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:

```
origin git@github.com:username/my-second-repo.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:username/my-second-repo.git (push)
```

---

## Cloning an Existing GitHub Repository

If you want to **copy** an existing project from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/my-second-repo.git
cd my-second-repo # Move into the cloned directory
```

- [~] This creates a local copy with `.git` history included.

---

## Pulling Changes from Remote to Local

To fetch the latest updates from GitHub:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- [!] If you don't have a matching branch locally, first switch to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

- Now your local repo is **up-to-date** with GitHub.

---

## Pushing Local Changes to Remote

After making changes, upload them to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update README.md"
git push origin main
```

- [~] Your changes are now on the remote repository.
