## What is Forking?

- **Forking** creates a **new copy** of a repository in your **own GitHub account**.
- Unlike branching (which stays in the same repository), **forking creates an entirely separate repository**.
- This is useful when contributing to **open-source projects** or working independently on a external project.

### Example Scenario

1. There is a **coolgame** repository.
2. **Joe forks** the repository, making a separate copy in his GitHub account.
3. Joe **makes changes** in his forked repository.
4. To **merge his changes back** into the original repository, Joe creates a **pull request**.
5. The **owner** of the original repository can **review** Joe's changes and **accept** them.

## How to Fork a Repository?

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. **Go to the GitHub repo** you want to fork.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top right corner.
3. Select your GitHub **account** to fork the repository.
4. GitHub will now **clone** the repository to your account.

- [~] You now have an **independent copy** of the repository in your GitHub account.

---

## Keeping Forks Updated

After forking, the repository **does not automatically sync** with the original. GitHub provides a **"Fetch upstream"** button to pull the latest changes.

---

## Making Changes in a Forked Repository

### 1. Clone the Forked Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coolgame.git
cd coolgame
```

- [~] This downloads the repository to your local machine.

### 2. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

- [~] This isolates changes in a **new branch**.

### 3. Make Changes and Commit

```bash
touch newfile.txt
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added new feature"
```

- [~] This tracks changes and **prepares them for push**.

### 4. Push the Changes to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

- [~] This uploads the branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Go to your forked repo on GitHub**.
2. Click on the **"New Pull Request"** button.
3. Select the **base repository** and **branch** to merge into.
4. Add a **title** and **description** for the PR.
5. Click on **"Create Pull Request"** to submit.

- [~] Now, the **original repo owner** can review, accept, or reject your changes\*\*.

---

## Summary

- [~] **Forking** creates a **new copy** of a repository in your GitHub account.
- [~] **Forked repositories** are **independent** of the original.
- [~] **After making changes, you submit a pull request** to merge them back into the original repository.
- [~] Useful for **open-source contributions** and **collaboration**.
