- [~] Create a new branch
- [~] Add & commit changes to the branch
- [~] Push the branch to GitHub
- [~] Create a pull request
- [~] Merge changes into `main`
- [~] Update your local repo with the latest changes

---

## Step 1: Verify Your Current Directory

Before doing anything, check your directory:

```bash
pwd # Print Working Directory
```

Ensure you're inside your Git repository (e.g., `my-first-repo`).

Then, check the Git status:

```bash
git status # Shows branch, untracked/modified files, and commit status
```

If everything is up-to-date, you'll see:

- [~] **"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main"**

---

## Step 2: Create a New Branch

Instead of working directly on `main`, create a **new branch** for your feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch # Create a new branch named 'feature-branch'
```

OR

```bash
git branch feature-branch # Create a new branch named 'feature-branch'
git checkout feature-branch # Switch to the new branch
```

- `git branch` creates the branch
- `git checkout` switches to the new branch

Verify your active branch using:

```bash
git branch # Lists all branches, with an asterisk (*) next to the active branch
```

---

## Step 3: Add a New File & Commit Changes

Create a new file:

```bash
touch test2.txt
```

Check status:

```bash
git status
```

Add the file for tracking:

```basyh
git add test2.txt
```

Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Added test2.txt"
```

- [~] **Now, your changes are saved locally but not yet on GitHub**

---

## Step 4: Push the Branch to GitHub

1. Open GitHub and go to your repository.
2. You'll see a **Compare & Pull Request** button-click it.
3. GitHub will show the differences between `feature-branch` and `main`.
4. Add a title & description, then click **Create Pull Request**.
5. Reviewers (if any) can approve or request changes.

---

## Step 6: Merge the Branch

Since this is your project, you can **merge** the PR yourself:

1. Click **Merge Pull Request** on GitHub.
2. Confirm the merge.
3. (Optional) Delete the branch after merging.

---

## Step 7: Update Your Local Repository

Switch back to `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Pull the latest changes (including the merged branch):

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Verify the new file is now in `main`:

```bash
ls
```

- [~] **Now, your branch is merged, and your local repo is up to date!**

---

## Key Takeaways

- [>] Always work in separate branches (avoid modifying `main` directly).
- [>] Push your branch to GitHub and create a **Pull Request** for review.
- [>] After merging, always **pull the latest changes** into your local repo.
