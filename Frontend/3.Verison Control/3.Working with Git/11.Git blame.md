When working in a team, it's crucial to **track who made changes, when they mad them, and what exactly changed**. This is where `git blame` comes in handy.

---

## What is `git blame`?

- `git blame` shows the history of a file **line by line**, including:

  - The **commit ID** (when the change was made)
  - The **author** (who made the change)
  - The **timestamp** (when the change was made)
  - The **line number** (where the change was made)
  - The **actual content** of the file

- [>] This helps **identify authorship** of every line in a file-useful for debugging, reviewing, and accountability.

---

## Using `git blame` in Different Scenarios

### 1. Checking Who Modified a File

To see the history of a file:

```bash
git blame feature.js
```

- [~] This will display each line's **author, commit ID, and timestamp**.

### 2. Understanding the Output

Example output:

```bash
a12b3c4d (John Doe 2025-03-19 10:00:00 +0300 1) const feature = 'awesome';
e56f7g8h (Jane Smith 2025-03-19 10:30:00 +0300 2) console.log(feature);
```

- **Commit ID:** `a12b3c4d` and `e56f7g8h`
- **Author:** `John Doe` and `Jane Smith`
- **Date & Time:** `2025-03-19 10:00:00` and `2025-03-19 10:30:00`
- **Line Number:** `1` and `2`
- **Content:** `const feature = 'awesome';` and `console.log(feature);`

---

### 3. Limiting Blame to Specific Lines

If the file is too large, you can **filter specific lines** using:

```bash
git blame -L 1,5 feature.js
```

- [~] This will show only **lines 1 to 5** of the file.

---

### 4. Viewing the Full Commit Details

To check the **full details** of a commit:

1. First, find the **commit hash** from `git blame`.
2. Then, use:

```bash
git show a12b3c4d
```

- [~] This will display **who made the change and what was Modified**.

---

### 5. Showing Email and Formatting Output

You can **customize the output:**

- **Show emails instead of names:**

```bash
git blame --show-email feature.js
```

- **Show full commit hashes:**

```bash
git blame --abbrev=48 feature.js
```

- **Change date format:**

```bash
git blame --data=iso feature.js
```

---

## When to Use `git blame`

- [~] Finding out **who last modified a specific line**
- [~] Debugging issues by tracking **when a bug was introduced**
- [~] Reviewing **historical changes in a project**
- [~] Holding developers **accountable for their code**

---

## Summary

- `git blame <file>` -> Shows who made each change.
- `git blame -L 1,5 <file>` -> Limits output to specific lines.
- `git show <commit>` -> Displays full commit details.
- Customize output with `--show-email`, `--abbrev`, and `--date`.
