# Understanding Git Workflow & GitHub Integration

Git and GitHub provide a structured **workflow** for tracking and managing changes in a project.

---

## Inside a Git Repository

When you create or clone a Git repository, it includes:

1. **README.md** - A text file describing the project
2. **.git Folder** - A hidden folder that stores all version history and tracking information.

To view these, use:

```bash
ls -la # Lists all files including hidden ones
```

## Git Workflow: Three Key States

Every file in a Git repository moves through three states:

| **State**    | **Description**                          | **Command Used**          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Modified** | A file has been edited but not tracked   | `nvim file.txt` (edit)    |
| **Staged**   | The file is tracked and ready for commit | `git add file.txt`        |
| **Commited** | The changes are saved in Git's history   | `git commit -m "message"` |

### Example Git Workflow

1. **Modify a file** (edit an existing or create a new file)

```bash
nvim newfile.txt
```

2. **Stage a file** (prepare if for commit)

```bash
git add newfile.txt
```

3. **Commit the file** (save changes to Git)

```bash
git commit -m "Add newfile.txt"
```

4. **Push the changes to GitHub** (sync with remote repository)

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Pulling a repository from GitHub

To get the latest changes from a remote GitHub repository, use:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This update your local repository with any new commits from GitHub.

## Summary of Git Workflow

- Modify files -> **Modified State** Add to staging -> **Staged State**
- Commit the changes -> **Committed State**
- Push to GitHub -> **Remote Repository**
