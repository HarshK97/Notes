## Checking Your Current Directory

Before making changes, confirm where you are in your file system using:

```bash
pwd # Print Working Directory
```

This tells you if you're inside your repository (e.g., `my-first-repo`).

---

## Checking Repository Status

It's always **good practice** to check for any pending changes before modifying files:

```bash
git status # Shows branch, untracked/modified files, and ciommit status
```

- If it says:
- [~] "Your branch is up to date" -> No changes pending.
- [!] "Untracked files" -> You have new files that Git is not tracking yet.

---

## Adding a New File

Create a new file using:

```bash
touch test.txt
```

Now, check the status again:

```bash
git status
```

- Git will say **"Untracked file: test.txt"**, meaning Git sees the file but isn't tracking changes yet.

---

## Tracking the New File

Use `git add` to start tracking `test.txt`:

```bash
git add test.txt
```

Check status again:

```bash
git status
```

- Git now recognizes **test.txt** as a "staged" file, ready to be committed.

---

## Undoing a Staged File

If you **accidentally** added the file and want to remove it from staging:

```bash
git restore --staged test.txt
```

Now, `git status` will show it as **untracked** again.

---

## Committing Changes

Once you're sure about the changes, commit them with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Adding a new file for testing"
```

- [>] The `-m` flag lets you add a new message explaining the commit.

- **Output Example:**

```
1 file changed, 0 insertions, 0 deletions
create mode 100644 test.txt
```

This means **test.txt was added to the Git history** but has no actual content yet.

---

## Checking the Status After Commit

```bash
git status
```

It should now say:

- [~] **"Nothing to commit, working tree clean."**

However, you'll also see:

- [!] **"Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. Use `git push` to publish your changes."**
