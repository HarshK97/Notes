## Pushing Changes to GitHub (git push)

After making changes locally, follow these steps to **upload them to the remote repository**:

1. **Check Your Branch & Status**

```bash
git status
git branch
```

- [~] This ensures you're on the current branch.

2. **Stage & Commit Your Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated test.txt with new content"
```

- [~] This prepares your changes for upload

3. **Push to GitHub**

```bash
git push origin main
```

- [~] This sends your local commits to the **main branch** on GitHub.

## Pulling Changes from GitHub (git pull)

If others have made changes, **get the latest updates before pushing**:

1. **Check for Updates**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- [~] This fetches new changes and merge them with your local code.

2. **Verify the Updates**

```bash
cat text.txt
```

- [~] If a new line was added on GitHub, it will now appear locally.

## Best Practices: Pull Before Pushing
