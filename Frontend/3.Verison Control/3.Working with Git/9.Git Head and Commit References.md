Every Git repository has a hidden `.git` folder, which keeps track of all changes. One key component of this folder is the `HEAD` file. The `HEAD` file points to the current branch you are working on. It is a reference to the last commit in the current branch.

---

## What is HEAD in Git?

- **HEAD is a reference** to the current branch or commit you are viewing.
- It is stored inside the `.git/HEAD` file.
- By default, HEAD points to the branch you are currently on.

---

## Checking the Current Branch in Git

To see which branch you are currently on:

```bash
git branch
```

- [~] The active branch will have an asterisk (`*`) next to it.

Alternatively, you can check the **HEAD reference** directly:

```bash
cat ./git/HEAD
```

- [>] This will output something like:

```bash
ref: refs/heads/main
```

- This means HEAD is pointing to the `main` branch.

---

## Switching Branches and Updating HEAD

When you switch branches, Git updates the HEAD reference to point to the new branch.

```bash
git checkout feature-xyz
```

Now, check HEAD again:

```bash
cat .git/HEAD
```

It will now point to:

```bash
ref: refs/heads/feature-xyz
```

- HEAD has moved to the `feature-xyz` branch.

---

## How HEAD Relates to Commits

Each branch points to a **commit ID**, which is stored in:

```bash
.git/refs/heads/<branch-name>
```

To see the latest commit ID of `main`:

```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

Example output:

```bash
8b55d9c90d3e2d6a8e5b1c4a3c2d0e1f2a4b6c7d
```

- This is the unique SHA-1 hash of the latest commit on the `main` branch.

---

## Updating HEAD to a Specific Commit

1. Modify a file (e.g., `README.md`).

```bash
nvim README.md
```

2. Stage the changes.

```bash
git adf README.md
```

3. Commit the changes.

```bash
git commit -m "Updated README"
```

4. Check the commit ID.

```bash
caty .git/refs/heads/main
```

- [~] The commit ID has **changed**, meaning the HEAD now points to the latest commit.

---

## Detached HEAD State

If you check out a commit instead of a branch:

```bash
git checkout <commit-id>
```

HEAD will point to a specific commit instead of a branch, causing a **detached HEAD state**. You can return to a branch using:

```bash
git checkout main
```

---

## Summary

- [~] **HEAD** tracks the current branch or commit.
- [~] It is stored inside `.git/HEAD`.
- [~] Each branch has a commit ID stored in `.git/refs/heads/<branch-name>`.
- [~] Committing changes updates the HEAD reference to the latest commit.
- [~] Checking out a commit instead of a branch results in a **detached HEAD state**.
