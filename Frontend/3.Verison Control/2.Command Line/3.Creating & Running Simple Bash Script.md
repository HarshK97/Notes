## 1. Navigating to the Home Directory

The **cd (change directory)** command moves you to he home directory

```bash
cd ~
```

---

## 2. Listing All Files (Including Hidden Files)

The `ls -la` command shows all files, including hidden ones (files starting with `.`).

- [>] **Command**:

```bash
ls -la
```

- You'll see files like:
- [~] **.bashrc** - Configuration file for the **Bash shell** (color, history, aliases, etc.
- [~] **.bash_profile** - Used mainly for setting **environment variables** (e.g., Java, Python, etc.)

---

## 3. Viewing Configuration Files

To view a file, use `less`:

- [>] **View** `.bashrc`:

```bash
less .bashrc
```

- [>] **View** `.bash_profile`:

```bash
less .bash_profile
```

- **Exit** `less`:
  Press **Q** to exit the file view.

## 4. Creating a Simple Bash Script

Let's create a script called `testshell.sh` using **Vim**:

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
vim testshell.sh
```

- Inside **Vim**, follow these steps:

  1. Press `i` to enter insert mode.
  2. Add the following **shebang (#!) line** to define the script as a **Bash** script.

  ```bash
  #! /bin/bash
  ```

  3. Add a simple **echo** command to print text:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```

  4. Press **Esc**, then type:

  ```bash
  :wq
  ```

  5. Press **Enter** to save and exit.

---

## 5. Making the Script Executable

By default, the script is not **executable**. Use `chmod` to change its permissions:

- [>] **Command**:

```bash
chmod -x testshell.sh
```

- [~] Now, the script can be executed!

---

## 6. Running the Script

To execute the script, use:

- [>] **Command**:

```bash
./testshell.sh
```

- [>] **Output**:

```bash
Hello, World!
```
