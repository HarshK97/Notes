## 1. Listing Files and Folders

To check what's in your current directory:

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
ls
```

- [~] Output:

```bash
archive projects
```

---

## 2. Navigating into the `archive` Folder

Use the `cd` (change directory) command:

- [>] **Command**:

```bash
cd archive
ls
```

- [~] Output:

```bash
submissions
```

---

## 3. Navigating into `submissions` and Listing Files

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
cd submissions
ls
```

- [~] Output:

```
file1.txt file2.txt
```

---

## 4. Viewing File Content with `cat`

To see the contents of `file1.txt`:

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
cat file1.txt
```

---

## 5. Counting Words in a File (`wc`)

The `wc` (word count) command is useful for counting:

- **Words** (`-w`)
- **Lines** (`-l`)
- Characters (`-c`)

To count words in `file1.txt`:

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
wc -w file1.txt
```

- [~] Output:

```
181 file1.txt
```

---

## Using Pipes (`|`) to Combine Commands

- **Pipes** (`|`) allow you to pass the output of one command as input to another.

### Counting Files in the Current Directory

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
ls | wc -w
```

- [~] Output:

```
2
```

(Since there are **two files**: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`)

### Word Count using `cat` and Pipes

Instead of running `wc -w file1.txt`, we can pass `cat`'s output into `wc`:

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
cat file1.txt | wc -w
```

- [~] Output:

```
181
```

### Counting Words in Multiple Files

- [>] **Command:**

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt | wc -w
```

- [~] Output:

```
362
```

(181 words from each file, combined)
