When you first start using a computer, you interact with it through a **mouse and keyboard**. But as you get more advanced, you can **interact through the command line** - a powerful tool that allows you to perform tasks faster and with more precision than a graphical user interface (GUI).

---

## What is Interaction with a Computer?

Interaction simply means **sending and receiving information** between you and the computer.
You interact using:

- **Input Devices**: Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone, Camera, etc.
- **Output Devices**: Monitor, Printer, Speaker, etc.

While **GUIs** make interaction easier, they **limit** the control you have over your system. This is where the **command line** comes in!

---

## Why Use the Command Line?

- [~] **Faster Execution** - Perform task quickly with commands.
- [~] **More Control** - Direct access to system processes.
- [~] **Automation** - Write scripts to automate tasks.
- [~] **Remote Access** - Manage servers remotely.

---

## Essential Command Line Commands

### 1. Changing Directories (cd)

Moves between folder (directories) in the file system.

- [>] **Examples**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop # Move to Desktop
cd .. # Move to the parent directories
cd /var/log # Move to the /var/log directory
```

### 2. Creating Files (touch)

Creates an empty file of any type.

- [>] **Example**:

```bash
touch example.txt # Creates a test file named example.txt
```

### 3. Creating Folders (mkdir)

Creates a new directory (folder).

- [>] **Example**:

```bash
mkdir my_project # Creates a folder named "my_project"
```

### 4. Viewing Command History (history)

Shows a list of recently used commands.

- [>] **Example**:

```bash
history | grep "mkdir" # Shows all mkdir commands used before
```

## Example Scenario: Setting up a JavaScript Project

Let's say you want to create a JavaScript project on your Desktop.
You need to:

- [~] Create a new folder **myjsproject**
- [~] Move into that folder
- [~] Create a new file **example.js**
- [~] Open it in your Favorite Text Editor

### Commands to Run

```bash
cd ~/Desktop # Move to Desktop
mkdir myjsproject # Create a new folder
cd myjsproject # Move into the folder
touch example.js # Create a new file
nvim example.js # Open the file in the nvim editor
```

After running these commands, your **example.js** file will be open in **Neovim**, ready for coding!

## Advanced Tasks You Can Do in the Command Line

- [~] **Manage Files & Directories**: Copy, Move, Delete, etc.
- [~] **Search Files & Text**: Find, Grep, etc.
- [~] **Control Remote Servers**: SSH, SCP, etc.
- [~] **Automate Tasks** - Write shell scripts to automate workflows.
- [~] **Manage Software** - Install, Update, Remove software packages.
- [~] **Monitor System Resources** - Check CPU, Memory, Disk usage.

## Conclusion

Using the command line **unlocks powerful ways** to interact with you computer. Just like using a mouse or keyboard became second nature, practicing these commands will make you more efficient.
