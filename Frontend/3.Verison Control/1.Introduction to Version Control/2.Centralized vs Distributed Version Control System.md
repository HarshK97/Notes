## Why Do Developers Need Version Control?

In a team environment, multiple developers work on the same project **simultaneously**.
Some might be working on **new features**, while others fix **bugs** or optimize **performance**.
With so many changes happening at once, **keeping track** of updates can be a challenge.

- [~] Version Control helps manage this by **tracking changes, resolving conflicts, and preventing accidental overwrites**.

---

## Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)

Version Control Systems can be categorized into **two types**:

1. **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**
2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**

While both **store and track code changes**, they have key differences in how they **operate and store data**.

---

## 1. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

- [>] **Example**: SVN (Subversion), Perforce

In **Centralized VCS**, there is a **single central server** that stores the entire project history.
Developers **pull (download)** the latest code from the server and **push (upload)** their changes back to it.

### How It Works

1. A developer **pulls** the latest version of the code from the **central repository**.
2. They make changes and **commit** them to the server.
3. Other developers can now **see** and **fetch** the changes.

### Key Features

- [~] **Single source of truth** -> The central server holds the latest and only copy of the code history.
- [~] **Access control** -> Administrators can control who can **read, write, or modify** the repository.

### Disadvantages of CVCS

- [!] **Requires internet connection** - Developers cannot work offline.
- [!] **Single point of failure** - If the server crashes, **all history can be lost**.
- [!] **Slower operations** - Every operation (commit, history check, etc.) requires a **server connection**.

---

## 2. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

- [>] **Example**: Git, Mercurial

In **Distributed VCS**, every developer has a **full copy** of the repository, including **all history**.
Developers can **commit changes locally** without needing a **server connection**.

### How It Works

1. A developer **clones** the repository -> This downloads the **entire history** to their local machine.
2. They make changes and **commit** them locally.
3. They can later **push** their changes to a remote server when ready.

### Key Features

- [~] **Faster operations** - Since everything is local, operations like commit and history checking are instant.
- [~] **Offline work** - Developers can work without an internet connection.
- [~] **Multiple backups** - If the server crashes, any developer's copy can restore the project.

### Disadvantages of DVCS

- [!] **Steeper learning curve** - DVCS tools (like Git) have more complex workflows.
- [!] **More disk space usage** - Every developer has a full copy of the project, which can be large for big repositories.

## Comparison Table: CVCS vs. DVCS

| **Feature**            | **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**   | **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Example**            | SVN, Perforce                | Git, Mercurial                        |
| **Repositroy**         | Single central server        | Every developer has a full copy       |
| **Intenet Dependency** | Requires internet connection | Can work offline                      |
| **Speed**              | Slower operations            | Faster operations                     |
| **Fault Tolerance**    | Server failure = Data loss   | Any copy can restore the repository   |
| **Collaboration**      | Requires server connection   | Can work independently and sync later |
| **Learning curve**     | Easier to learn              | Steeper learning curve                |

## Why is Git the Most Popular DVCS?

Git is the **most widely used** distributed version control system today. It is used by companies like **Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Netflix**
because of its:

- [~] **Speed** - Local commits are almost instant.
- [~] **Branching** - Developers can work on multiple features in parallel.
- [~] **Collaboration** - GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket make teamwork easier.
- [~] **Fault Tolerance** - Even if the central server fails, every developer has a backup.
