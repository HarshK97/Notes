## What is Version Control?

Version Control is a **system that records and tracks changes** made to files over time. Developers use it to:

- [~] Keep track of code modifications.
- [~] Revert to previous versions when needed.
- [~] Collaborate with other developers efficiently.
- [~] Maintain a history of changes with author details.

In software development, version control is often referred to as **Source Control** or **Source Code Management (SCM)**.

---

## Why is Version Control Important?

Imagine writing a long document and making many edits. A few days later, you realize you need an earlier version, but you **don't have a backup**. You'd have to **redo everything manually**.
Version control **solves this problem for developers** by keeping snapshots of changes, allowing you to roll back when necessary.

---

## Benefits of Version Control

Here are the key benefits of using a version control system:

### 1. Revision History

- Every change is **recorded and saved**.
- Developers can **roll back** to any stable version.
- Helps in debugging when an update introduces a **bug**.

### 2. Identity & Accountability

- Changes are linked to the **developer** who made them.
- This helps teams track who made a **specific edit**.
- Useful for analyzing **when** and **why** a change was made.

### 3. Collaboration

- Developers work **together** on the same project.
- Changes from multiple people are **merged** seamlessly.
- Prevents overwriting each other's work.

### 4. Peer Reviews & Code Quality

- Before merging changes, developers request a **peer review**.
- Other developers review the code and provide **feedback**.
- This ensures **high-quality** and **well-structured** code.

### 5. Automation & Efficiency

- Version control integrates with **DevOps** for smooth deployments.
- Supports **Continuous Integration/Continue Deployment (CI/CD)**.
- Helps in **testing** to ensure new updates **don't break existing features**.

## How Does Version Control Work?

A version control system (VCS) keeps track of file changes using a structured process:

1. **You make changes** -> Edit, add, delete files.
2. **You save a shapshot (commit)** -> Records the changes made.
3. **You push the changes** -> Updates the shared repository (for teams).
4. **You can revert** -> If something goes wrong, roll back to a previous version.

- Example: **Git**, the most popular version control system, uses `commit` commands to save snapshots of your code.

---

## Types of Version Control Systems

There are two main types of version control:

### 1. Centralized Version Control (CVCS)

- A **single central server** stores all versions.
- Developers **pull** the latest changes and **push** their changes to the server.
- Example: **SVN (Apache Subversion)**.

- [!] **Drawback**: If the central server crashes, the entire history **may be lost**.

### 2. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)

- Each developer has a **local copy** of the entire repository.
- Developers can work **offline** and sync changes later.
- Example: **Git, Mercurial**.

- [~] **Advantage**: If the main server crashes, any developer's copy can **restore the repository**.
- [>] Most modern teams use **Git**, a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.

---

## Version Control & Agile Development

Many teams follow the **Agile methodology**, where work is broken down into **iterations (sprints)** (usually 2 weeks long).
Version control helps teams in Agile by:

- [~] Keeping track of features added in each sprint.
- [~] Ensuring smooth collaboration between developers.
- [~] Allowing quick rollbacks if something goes wrong.

---

## Getting Started with Version Control

If you want to start using version control, the most common tool is **Git**.

### Basic Git Commands

```bash
git init # Initialize a new repository
git clone url # Clone a remote repository
git status # Check the current state of the repo
git add file.txt # Stage a file for commit
git commit -m "Message" # Save changes with a message
git push origin main # Push changes to the remote repo
git pull origin main # Get the latest changes from the repo
```

- **Popular Platforms**:
  - **Github** (Most widely used, cloud-based Git storage).
  - **GitLab** (CI/CD integration).
  - **Bitbucket** (Used by enterprises).

---

## Summary

- [~] Version control helps **track changes** and **restore older versions**.
- [~] It improves **collaboration, efficiency, and code quality**.
- [~] Git is the most widely used **distributed version control system**.
- [~] Version control is a **core part of DevOps and Agile development**.
